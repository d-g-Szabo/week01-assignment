Liftoff is set for 10:34 p.m. EDT (0234 May 7 GMT), with landing set for a week later in the southwestern U.S. Follow our live updates of the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission here from launch to landing!

        A ticket for a 90-minute trip to space will set you back $450,000 (Â£356,000). According to Virgin Galactic, it's a price people are willing to pay. "Demand is high", the company's website says, with several hundred customers already in line to fly. What does this mean for the future of space tourism?

        The cost of space travel will decrease as technology advances and more companies enter the market. <br/>SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are leading the way in commercial space travel, with plans to offer suborbital and orbital flights to the public. <br/>The cost of a ticket to space is currently around $250,000-$500,000, but prices are expected to drop to $50,000-$100,000 within the next decade. <br/>Space tourism will become more accessible to the general public as the industry grows and competition increases. <br/>The future of space travel is bright, with the potential for regular commercial flights to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
