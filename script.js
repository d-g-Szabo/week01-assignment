        The cost of space travel will decrease as technology advances and more companies enter the market. <br/>SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are leading the way in commercial space travel, with plans to offer suborbital and orbital flights to the public. <br/>The cost of a ticket to space is currently around $250,000-$500,000, but prices are expected to drop to $50,000-$100,000 within the next decade. <br/>Space tourism will become more accessible to the general public as the industry grows and competition increases. <br/>The future of space travel is bright, with the potential for regular commercial flights to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
